
# EX.NO : 12(A)  INSERTION SORT 
 
# PROGRAM STATEMENT: 
 
To write a CPP Program to get the elements of an Array which needs to be sorted using insertion sort. 
 
# ALGORITHM:   
 
1. Start the program. 
2. Define the function input(int arr[]) that takes an array arr[] as an argument. 
3. Loop from i = 0 to i = 4 (5 iterations): 
a. Prompt the user to input an integer. 
b. Store the entered integer in arr[i] using scanf. 
4. End the program. 
 
# PROGRAM:
```
void input(int arr[]){
     for(int i=0; i<5; i++)
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
}
```

# output:

# RESULT: 
 
Thus, the C++ program to get the elements of an Array, which needs to be sorted using insertion sort, is created successfully.
